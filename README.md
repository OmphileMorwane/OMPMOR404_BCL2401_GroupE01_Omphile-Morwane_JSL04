# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

**Ojective:** The objective of this project is to use ternary operators to solve problems.
In each of these challenges, the ternary operator is used to decide between two options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic.

## Learning outcome:

I gained practical experience in structuring code to achieve specific goals and effectively manage various scenarios using ternary operators in conditional statements. I learned that ternary operators are the shorthand for expressing conditional logic and one needs to be careful using ternary operators as they can be tideous for complex statements. It is advisable to use them for simple statements.
